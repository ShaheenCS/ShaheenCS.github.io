Website basics.

Template.html is a simplistic HTML & CSS based file created to be easily used in later projects.

Template is being used to familiarize myself with:
  Webkit: toolbars, animations
  Testing different layouts 
  Having fun with div

// TODO
Future goals and implementations are to run a working template using node.js, ergo working to hone my skills in JavaScript.
Include:  Local host / port, 404 page
